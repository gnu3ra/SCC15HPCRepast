Manual Installation of Repast HPC


The normal installation process for Unix systems,

" configure; make; make install " 

can be difficult to use in the HPC environments where Repast HPC will commonly
be deployed. The Makefile in this folder is a bare-bones way to build the Repast HPC libraries 
and the executables for the included demos. When run it will create 
a repast_hpc install directory that includes:

include/
   repast-hpc/
      (All Repast HPC Header Files
   relogo/
      (All ReLogo Header Files)
lib/
  repast-hpc.a
  relogo.a
bin/
  rumor_model.exe
  zombie_model.exe

To run this makefile, you must provide values for each of the variables in the
list below. You can do this by editing values directly in the Makefile (the first several
lines are provided just for this), or by invoking 'make' from the command line with these 
variables specified, e.g.:

   make -f Makefile_MANUAL CXX="mpicxx -g -O3" BOOST_INCLUDE=/home/Boost/Boost_1.54/include"

Note that this makefile assumes that the mpi header and library files are already known to your
compiler, and invoking the compiler will automatically find these required files. Most common
mpi installations provide a compiler wrapper that does this automatically; refer to your mpi
version's documentation.

Variable Definitions:

CXX - The command used to invoke your c++ compiler of choice. Include all associated flags
     for optimization or debugging. 
     Example: CXX="mpicxx -O3"

CXXLD - The command used to invoke your linker of choice. Include all associated flags.
     Example: CXXLD="mpicxx"

BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory in which the Boost library header files are found
     Example: BOOST_INCLUDE=/home/Boost/Boost_1.54/include

BOOST_LIB_DIR - The directory in which the Boost compiled libraries are found
     Example: BOOST_LIB_DIR=/home/Boost/Boost_1.54/lib

BOOST_INFIX - Boost libraries can be named by a pattern, such as 
     "libboost_serialization-gcc41-mt-d-1_54.a" and "libboost_mpi-gcc41-mt-d-1_54.a"
     All values between the end of the specific library name (e.g. 'serialization') and 
     the final dot can vary to specify the compiler, boost version, and other details.
     Use this variable to specify the infix to be used that matches the libraries installed on your system
     Example: BOOST_INFIX="-gcc41-mt-d-1_54"

NETCDF_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory in which the NetCDF library header files are found
     Example: NETCDF_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/users/jsmith/NetCDF/Version1/include

NETCDF_LIB_DIR - The directory in which the NetCDF library files are found
     Example: NETCDF_LIB_DIR=/home/users/jsmith/NetCDF/Version1/lib

CURL_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory in which the Curl library header files are found
     Example: CURL_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/users/jsmith/CURL/include

CURL_LIB_DIR = The directory in which the Curl library file is found
     Example: CURL_LIB_DIR=/home/users/jsmith/lib


Note: For simplicity, this makefile does not calculate dependencies on header files or beyond.
