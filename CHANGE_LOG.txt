Repast HPC 2.0  Change Log

Release Date: 13 August 2013
==========================================================

The most significant change to Repast HPC Version 2.0
is the revision of cross-process synchronization, which
has been virtually entirely rewritten. See the manual
and the included demos for documentation and details.


The other change is that te hierarchy of spatial objects 
has been changed to reflect standard naming; there are now 
only 'DiscreteSpaces' and 'ContinuousSpaces' not 'Grids'
and 'Spaces'. Additionally, Continuous Spaces can now
have boundaries at non-integer points. ReLogo spaces
now align at the .5 boundary instead of on the integer.


Bug Fixes:

1) Use reference, not copy, in TurtlesOn

2) AgentStateFilters use common communicator

3) CountsOfRequests array uninitialized causing spurious data
in RepastProcess initiateAgentRequest

4) Reconcile names of provideEdgeContent in Repast 
and ReLogo code
